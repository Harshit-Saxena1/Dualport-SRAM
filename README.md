# Dualport-SRAM
This project implements a Dual-Port SRAM using Verilog, designed to allow both read and write operations based on a clock signal. The module features an 8-bit addressable memory with 4-bit data storage at each location. The control signals include chip select (cs), write enable (write), and read enable (read). The memory operations occur on the rising edge of the clock, ensuring synchronized data storage and retrieval. If cs is low, the output defaults to 0000, preventing unintended reads. The corresponding testbench (Dualport_SRAM_tb.v) verifies the module's functionality by writing data to memory, reading it back, and checking its correctness using waveform analysis (Dualport_SRAM_tb.vcd). The testbench also includes a clock generator and various test cases to validate memory behavior. This project serves as a fundamental component in memory design for digital circuits and can be integrated into larger systems like microprocessors and cache memory units.
